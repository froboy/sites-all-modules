Wp2Drupal is not a standalone migration script but rather a standard Drupal module.

PROS:
+ Familiar user interface
+ Script can use Drupal functions instead of raw database access

CONS:
- Raw Wordpress queries (issued using standard mysql_query) somehow interfere with Drupal connection settings. For example, this is imposible:

while ($wp_post = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
  watchdog(...);
}

because watchdog() internally issues db_query command and this can not occur within while loop with another active MySQL connection. Consequences: you must write something like

$wp_posts = array();
while ($wp_post = mysql_fetch_assoc($result)) {
  $wp_posts[] = $wp_post;
}

foreach ($wp_posts as $wp_post) {
  watchdog(...);
}

A big drawback is that when there are many posts, $wp_posts can become very large. One possible solution is to store MySQL results into, say, SQLite database but this optimization feature is not currently implemented.

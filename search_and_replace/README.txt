INSTALATION
*Place the search_and_replace directory in the correct modules folder as you would any other Drupal module
*Turn it on in your Drupal site
*Goto admin/settings/search_and_replace to replace all the text you want
*If you want to replace a text string with nothing then type %NULL% for the replacement term

KNOWN ISSUES
Using the backslash / character can screw up where replacements start / end.  Still working on it (maintaining like 6 projects at the moment)
